# One-shot bootstrap of the AUR `bmcctl-bin` package repo.
#
# AUR creates the git repo on first SSH push, but only if the push has
# at least one commit. Goreleaser's `aurs:` block (and aur-bump.sh) rely
# on git-clone working, which requires the repo to already exist AND to
# contain a HEAD ref. So somebody has to push the very first PKGBUILD +
# .SRCINFO. This script does that - exactly once, then never again
# (subsequent updates flow through goreleaser on every git tag).
#
# Idempotent against re-runs: if the AUR repo is already non-empty,
# this prints a hint and exits 0.
#
# Requires:
#   - SSH access to aur@aur.archlinux.org as a maintainer of the package
#     (works if your ~/.ssh/config has an IdentityFile that's listed on
#     your AUR profile - current setup uses ~/.ssh/aur_ed25519_bot).
#   - That a release matching $1 (default 0.1.0) is already published at
#     https://github.com/j4y-w4lk3r/bmcctl/releases.
